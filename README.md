Glozzom is a multi-page website theme aimed at selling a membership
service or something of that nature.

It makes use of Bootstrap 4.1.1, Font Awesome, jQuery, Lightbox and popper.js

Image files  and /node_modules have been ignored to save storage space and
sync efficiency. They are just place holder images anyway. So you aren't really
missing out on much there.
